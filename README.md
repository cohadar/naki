If forgetting is exponential, it implies a constant probability of forgetting in unit time

In Algorithm SM-8, we hoped that retrievability information might be derived from grades. This turned out to be false. There is very little correlation between grades and retrievability, and it primarily comes from the fact that complex items get worse grades and tend to be forgotten faster (at least at the beginning).


keeping complex material at lower priorities is a good learning strategy.


To illustrate the importance of homogenous samples in studying forgetting curves,,,


When competition with others is the chief motivator, it will mostly reward the winners. Students who live for grades have no habit of setting meaningful goals. This habit is trainable, and should be developed from the youngest ages. Self-motivation is the best propeller of a good life.


The main problem with straight A kids is that they are too busy with learning for school and have no time to develop their passions. I love reading biographies. I read hundreds, and I always focus on early life looking for factors that determine greatness. I recall very few cases of great people who were great and well-polished students.
Just the opposite, it is the rebellious types and the self-learning types that usually spring to greatness.
