When I researched conventional chemo and radiation, I found out that they did a lot of detrimental things. They can: kill the P53 tumor-suppressor gene, the very gene you need to fight cancer; distort the DNA of your healthy cells making them pre-cancerous; weaken the immune system; damage the vital body organs; cause cancer to build up immunities against the chemo and radiation; and, have many violent side effects, severely impacting quality of life.
