Cancer builds up an immunity to treatments, so it is important to switch things around. Keep it at bay with different patterns, different supplements, different treatments. I walk, do yoga, colonics, visualization and prayer. I also take lots of supplements, drink lots of Essiac tea and sometimes take Chinese herbs.
