The whole appointment of Hitler by Hindenburg in 1933 should therefore look incredibly suspicious.
Hitler was just 43 and had done nothing important. He had held no offices, had never been elected to
anything, had quit the army as a lowly corporal, and hadn't even graduated from high school. He had
zero qualifications for anything in government. He was not legally a citizen of Germany, since his
citizenship had been faked the year before. And he was ineligible for any office due to his treason
conviction. So basically, this is the stupidest story anyone has ever told another person.
