Spirit, reason, truth, brotherhood, justice: these great things, without which there is no true humanity, which ancient paganism had half perceived and Christianity had instituted, quickly became unreal when no longer seen as a radiation from God, when faith in the living God no longer provides their vital substance. They become empty formsâ€¦Without God, even truth is an idol, even justice is an idol.
