Vaccines are not magic, like everything else, they need to be subjected to a basic risk/reward analysis.  But the scientific community has not only failed to due its duty to provide the public with the necessary information to perform this analysis, it has clearly failed to inform the public of the risks even when they were known, and known to be potentially fatal.

Some vaccines are necessary for certain people at certain times.  Gardasil and Cervarix are not, and no parent with a teenage daughter should permit her to receive them.
