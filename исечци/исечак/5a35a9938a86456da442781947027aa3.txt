How can you identify a moderate? He is the man who only shoots at his own side and never at the enemy. Moderates merit friendly civility, but no respect. They are often useful, if irritating allies, but do not permit them any input into strategy and tactics or decisionÂ­making. And do not accept them as leaders except of their own moderate faction. They are considerably worse than useless in that regard, because they are constantly trying to find a middle ground that quite often does not exist.
