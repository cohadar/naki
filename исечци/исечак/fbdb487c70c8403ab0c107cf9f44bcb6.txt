There is always a point in my research when I stop and start writing. It usually comes surprisingly
early—well before anyone else would start writing. It happens when I find a clue so formidable, so
unanswerable, I know I won't be wasting my time writing. It is that point when I am so certain I am on
the right track, there is no chance I will discover I was wrong. So I simply start writing—before having
done most of the research I will end up doing—knowing it will turn out. In other words, I don't do the
research first, and then write it up. I do maybe thirty minutes of fishing on the web, find that indice
formidable, and immediately start writing. I then research as I write, looking for what I need to
continue. I always find it.
