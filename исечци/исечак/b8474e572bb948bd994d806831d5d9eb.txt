"<div>This is what SO many people never understand about edumacating folks. It's NOT the idiot you're arguing with who is your actual intended audience -- it's the lurkers and listeners. Try to think of the idiot you're arguing with as a TRAINING DEVICE (think: training dummy) that let you explain ""in front of"" the semi-interested, or actually interested but ""shy,"" folks to whom you're actually speaking!</div><div><br /></div><div>That's why it's a waste of your time to do it one-on-one; you're right -- the arguer won't ever get it! Keep your mind on your AUDIENCE and keep working! They are your target!</div>"	<div>I used to run a dating and marrying advice list for girls and women. I'd astonish some of them when I would 'keep after' some idiot for hours or days, answering (calmly and with education as MY goal) the stupidest whines and rants. Pushing chastity till at least engaged; respect for men all the time (until they proved unworthy, and that was an exceedingly high bar!); graceful, ladylike speech (even when hurt or angry); and so on, which really ... twerked ... some feminist noses! Finally, the huffy fem would flounce off (or some very few would begin to see the light).</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, some of the quieter (or new: I really liked that!) girls would come out of the woodwork to say how my long discussions had helped them, and what they'd learned or figured out. Tremendous fun! (Esp. cause I didn't give a tinker's dam if the feminist got it at all!)</div>
