You may not understand why I would think that, so I will just tell you. It is because I always assume
that the two top-ranked stories on any subject are both false. That is what I have always found, so it is
a logical assumption. On any websearch, the truth will either be unlisted or it will be downlisted to
oblivion. Since the Frankenberger story came up near the top of the first page, I assumed it was
garbage, just like the mainstream story. Remember that: the mainstream story and the alternative story
are always both false.
