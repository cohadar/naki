The fathers of all seven Ecumenical councils, who laid the foundations for our Church and Orthodox faith, they all confessed without exception that light has nothing in common with darkness. Life and death cannot be fused. Light and darkness cannot converge. When light appears, darkness dissipates. Where there is no light, darkness predominates. Truth and Falsehood cannot be conjoined, they cannot be “one.” As a result, Christian unity as conceived and preached by ecumenists is simply impossible.
