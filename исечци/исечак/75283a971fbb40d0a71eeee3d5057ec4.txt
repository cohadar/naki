There is nothing genuinely elite about the modern faux-elite. They are not our moral, intellectual, or even physical superiors. They are uniformly frauds, from their dyed-hair on the top of their heads to the lifts they wear in the soles of their shoes. Most of them are not even very attractive or physically fit.	Vox Day
